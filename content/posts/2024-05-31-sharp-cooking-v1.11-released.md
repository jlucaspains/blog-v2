I'm excited to announce the release of Sharp Cooking v1.11.0! This update brings several new features and improvements to enhance your cooking experience.

### 1. Set Recipe Language
One of the new features allows you to set the language for individual recipes. For example, when my mom sends me one of her amazing recipes in Portuguese, I can now set the recipe language accordingly. This way, I can still use Sharp Cooking's highlighting and parsing features effectively, even if the recipe is not in the same language as the app.

### 2. Dependency Upgrades
We've updated several libraries used in Sharp Cooking since the last release. These updates ensure the app is equipped with the latest features and security patches, keeping your cooking experience smooth and secure.

### 3. New Bug Report issue form
While not a direct improvement to the app, we've created a new issue template for bug reports. This will help us understand and resolve issues more quickly, improving the overall development process.

### 4. General Bug Fixes
We've fixed issues related to nutritional labels and backups that were introduced in the previous release. These fixes ensure the app runs more smoothly and accurately.
