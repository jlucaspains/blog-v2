In my previous post, I announced that the Sharp Cooking Companion Chrome Extension was under review in the Chrome Web Store. I'm happy to say that it's now available for download!

The extension allows users to browse recipe websites normally in Chrome or Edge. When a recipe is desired, the user can click the extension icon and it will scrape the recipe data and generate a share code. Users can then paste or scan the share code in the app to import the recipe.

As with any Chrome Store extension, you can install to Chrome, Edge, and some other chromium based browsers. The extension is free to use and open-source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlucaspains/sharp-cooking-web).

Finally, you can find the extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/Sharp%20Cooking%20Recipe%20Importer/npcfgngbjnphcgkpkclpfdmhacahbgga?hl=en&authuser=0).

Cheers,\
